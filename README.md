Agri-Ok is an IoT-driven precision agriculture platform designed to empower farmers with actionable insights using real-time data from sensors in the field. The platform provides:

Data analytics and machine learning to optimize crop health, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.
A user-friendly interface for farmers to access real-time insights, alerts, and data monitoring.
A robust backend and scalable cloud infrastructure with seamless IoT device integration.
Features
Real-Time Data Collection:

IoT sensors monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and pH levels.
Data is transmitted to a local server and processed using the MQTT protocol, stored in a time-series database for real-time analysis.
Machine Learning-Driven Insights:

Predictive models forecast irrigation needs, detect anomalies (e.g., pest outbreaks), and generate actionable recommendations.
User Interface:

Responsive web interface built with React.js to monitor farm conditions and receive alerts in real-time.
Data visualization using D3.js or Chart.js for easy trend analysis.
Cloud-Based Infrastructure:

Cloud platforms provide scalability and automated deployment.
Seamless IoT data integration via MQTT for real-time data streaming.
Mobile Accessibility:

Mobile-friendly design for on-the-go access from smartphones or tablets.
