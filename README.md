Agri-Ok: Precision Agriculture Solution
Overview
Agri-Ok is a cutting-edge precision agriculture platform designed to help farmers optimize crop yield, manage resources efficiently, and promote sustainable farming. By integrating IoT sensors with real-time data processing, machine learning models, and an intuitive user interface, Agri-Ok provides actionable insights to farmers, including irrigation scheduling, fertilization guidance, and pest control recommendations.

Project Architecture
The platform uses a multi-layered architecture for seamless data flow and efficient processing of sensor data. Here’s a high-level view of the system:

Components:
Farm Sensors: IoT devices collect real-time data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH levels).
Local Server: Receives data from the sensors and forwards it to the hosted server via MQTT protocol.
Hosted Server: Web server and MQTT broker that handle the data flow from farm sensors to the backend application.
Machine Learning Models: Analyze sensor data in real-time and generate actionable insights.
Front-End: A user-friendly dashboard for farmers to monitor sensor data and receive recommendations.
Backend: Processes and stores data, while providing APIs for front-end and machine learning integration.
Database: Stores time-series sensor data and user-specific recommendations.
Features
Real-Time Data Monitoring: Farmers can view live sensor readings for soil moisture, temperature, and other critical metrics.
Actionable Recommendations: The system provides advice on when to water crops, apply fertilizers, or take preventive actions based on machine learning predictions.
Mobile Access: The front-end is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring farmers can monitor their fields from anywhere.
Scalable Infrastructure: Built using cloud infrastructure for scalability, ensuring it can handle data from large farms with multiple sensors.
Model Development and Evaluation
Features
Model Creation: The machine learning models focus on time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, and decision tree algorithms.
Training: Models are trained on historical sensor data and validated to provide optimal performance for specific farm environments.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Reports
Pipeline Creation
Functions
Modular Pipeline: Each step of the pipeline—from data collection to analysis—is modular, allowing flexibility and easy updates.
Retraining Mechanism: A mechanism is included to retrain models periodically using new data, ensuring accuracy in changing environmental conditions.
